<p>If you're a recruiter who's looking at this, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DrJDoql83PLR6hq1CTtIcQUmwwrnQgjaFxrbZ3aJ6sg/edit?usp=sharing">here's my resume</a>.</p>

<p>If you're a recruiter who's looking at this and wondering why this webpage looks like it's from the early 90's, please note that I am not applying for any frontend design positions.</p>  

<p>Hello, world! Below are some personal projects I've done 
that I'm proud enough of to show off.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="SortVis/index.html">Sort Visualizer with JavaScript/Canvas</a>
    <ul>
        <li>Did this way back while taking my first algorithms class</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li><a href="TextFormatter/index.html">TextFormatter, written in Python</a>
    <ul>
        <li>A way to format any block of text into to any given shape. Wrote this because I had an idea for a tshirt deisgn for my school's ACM chapter, and couldn't find a tool quite like this anywhere else.</li>
    </ul>
</li> 
<li><a href="TextFormatterJavascript/index.html">TextFromatter, written in Javascript</a>
    <ul>
        <li>The same as above, but written in Javascript so it's actually useful to people.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>CBE GPA Calculator
    <ul>
        <li>This is my senior project. Long story short, the College of Business and Economics had a Chrome Extension the advisors and students used to simplify the process of figuring out their college-specific GPA. This extension was produced by a previous senior project team. My team (myself and three others) were brought on to fix some lingering bugs and produce a mobile application that did the same. For my part, I wrote the Android application.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/WWUCBE/AndroidApp">Android Application (Controller and and View), written in Java</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/WWUCBE/kotlin-backend">Backend (Model), written in Kotlin</a></li>
        
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>
