<h1>Humans Vs. Zombies &#151; the app</h1>



<p><b>Introduction</b></p>

<p>The core premise of a Humans vs. Zombies application is to enable teams to communicate and strategize in an effective and simple manner.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen a lone human trying to sneak though a parking lot, and wanted a way to call down a hoard of your zombie brethren? This app is for you.</p>

<p>Have you ever been trapped in a building with no allies in sight, and wanted a way to call for backup before you missed your next class? This app is for you.</p>

<p><b>Features</b></p>

<i>The basics</i> 
<p>Communicate with the game server, allowing players to log kills, view the current score, see achievements, read mission announcements, etc.</p>

<i>The fun stuff</i>
<p>The main way to interact with this app will be through a map of the campus. On this map will be displayed various icons; the player's location, the location of all allies (well, those who have the app) and last known positions of enemies. The latter will be placeable by users. For example, a zombie that sees a human can quickly place a marker on the map, which will then be visible on the maps of all zombie players. </p>

<p>A secondary feature would be a simple global chat that would allow players to directly talk with their teammates. </p>

<p><b>The Details</b></p>

<p>The above features are the core of what would make up the app. The way they're implemented, however, is what moves the app from the "neat idea" category to the "actually useful" category. As such, there's a lot of room for changes and improvements here; the following are just a few possible ideas.</p>

<i>Enemy Icons</i>

<p>When placing enemy icons, the player will be able to specify a vector &#151; that is, the direction the enemy players were moving . This would be represented by a small arrow on the icon. Further, the player could specify the number of enemies, if there's more than one. </p>

<i>Voice Notifications</i>

<p>With a game like HvZ, you don't want to have to keep pulling your phone out of your pocket to check if there's any new notifications. To this end, there could be voice notifications. For example: "Ally at Bond Hall needs assistance" or, "Two humans six hundred feet from your position, headed northeast." Note that the second example would use the vector information from the previous idea. This voice would be provided by a text to speech program.</p>
